* What

Stefil os a very thin Common Lisp testing "framework" where tests are
simply augmented `defun`'s, coupled with a smarter `ASSERT` macro
(called `IS`). Unexpected situations are integrated into the condition
system with additional restarts.

* Status

It's a mature project that has been exercised a lot.

It's not that there's no room left for improvements, though, but
development has stalled for years.

Stefil was the pioneer of this kind of testing anti-frameworks, but I
think there are better alternatives today. See below.

* Where

The project's [[https://github.com/hu-dwim/hu.dwim.stefil][Github page]] is the primary communication channel.

* Why

The normal CL development workflow with Slime is excellent, and I saw
no reason for all the preexisting testing frameworks interfering with
it.

* Alternatives
** [Try](https://github.com/melisgl/try)
After a cursory look `Try` seems to be a much more thorough
implementation of the same idea.

** Fiasco
Fiasco is a friendly fork: https://github.com/capitaomorte/fiasco
Here's the pre-fork discussion: https://github.com/luismbo/stefil/issues/9

> in short: at this time i (attila) am not working actively on
> hu.dwim.stefil, and IIRC the proposed changes were too divergent, so
> we agreed to fork off fiasco from hu.dwim.stefil.
