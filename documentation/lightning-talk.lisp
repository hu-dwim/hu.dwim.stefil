test suite - specialized app (asserts)

others:
- too much "framework"-y stuff
- test suites look much different than real applications
- why new abstractions? aren't DEFUN's good enough?

stefil:
- ensured dynamic environment
- ensured by DEFTEST, which is an insturmented DEFUN
- macrology: IS, SIGNALS, FINISHES, WITH-EXPECTED-FAILURES
- copy-pastable into the REPL
- integration with slime
- collected data is returned as the n+1th value
- entry point anywhere

IN-SUITE: mimicing in-package.
 - SUITE's are also DEFUN's. -RUN-CHILD-TESTS- is a lexically visible function
   for wrapping suite bodies in a certain environment.

...which leads to fixtures: code pieces :setup/:teardown

result:
- small, minimal impedance mismatch
- test failure is the same as application failure: same tools, same way of fixing bugs.
- test suite is just a specialized application with loads of asserts
